        <h1>Testing the ABN AMRO API</h1>
            Once you click the link the consent flow will start.
            The Abn Amro API will be called and eventually you will be redirected to the Abn Amro consent page.
            In there you can select an account and for that account the balance and transactions are then fetched.
